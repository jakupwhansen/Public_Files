Cats are cute,
They like to scoot,
They purr and meow,
And like to prowl.

They’re soft and furry,
And never in a hurry,
They nap all day,
And love to play.

Cats are curious,
And sometimes mischievous,
They climb up high,
And never say die.

They’re graceful and sleek,
And never miss a beat,
They’re always on the go,
And never too slow.

Cats are independent,
And sometimes indifferent,
But they’re always there,
When you need them to care.

They’re loyal and true,
And always there for you,
They’re more than just pets,
They’re family, you bet!

Dogs are loyal,
And never spoil,
They wag their tails,
And never fail.

They’re man’s best friend,
Until the very end,
They’re always there,
And never scare.

Dogs are playful,
And sometimes grateful,
They fetch and run,
And love to have fun.

They’re furry and cute,
And always astute,
They’re more than just pets,
They’re family, you bet!

A girl and a boy,
Together they enjoy,
The sun and the sea,
And all that’s free.

They laugh and play,
And never stray,
From each other’s side,
They’re always in stride.

They talk and share,
And never despair,
For they know that love,
Is what they’re made of.

They dance and sing,
And never cling,
To the past or the pain,
For they know that love will remain.

They’re happy and free,
And always agree,
That love is the key,
To their destiny.
